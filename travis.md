## Core concepts on CI [Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners)

> Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.

Basically, TravisCI will help automate testing code changes and give feedback.
